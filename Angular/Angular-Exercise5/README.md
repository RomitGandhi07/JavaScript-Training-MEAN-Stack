# AngularExercise5
Here I have created 2 directives, one is attribute directive and another one is structural directive.

Font-size updator
-----------------
1) Here if given ```html <p fontSizeUpdator>Demo</p> ``` then it will apply default font-size to 30 px

2) Here if given ```html <p fontSizeUpdator="52px">Demo</p>``` then it will apply font-size to 52px. Means given value will be applied as font-size.


isAuthorized
------------
Here, new item can be added and add/remove privilleges and if privilleges is not there then visible will not be displayed.

All these functionalities can be done runtime.
